Content: My name is Kingsley Amoategn and I am starting out with github. I am a complete beginner with no knowledge in this field but I am very passionate about what I am learning and I am hoping that I would be consistent and hardworking to be able to climb up the ladder of cloud computing which has lead me to this place.
Everyone starts somewhere , I am having learning about data analysis for the past three months and I just started learning about python 
a few days ago after completing excel,sql basics and some powerbi creating of dashboard and other things.I know I have not completely master any of them 
but I would eventually complete them .I just want to have a feel of each of the tools I would be using in the near future and keep on advancing in these field of data and IT.
